Talk to Paige about cloning the repo

###File Structure
The django framework uses a particular file structure. The repo is called buku, and all work should be in there. 
Inside the repo there is a folder called project that contains all of the project files. In project, there are two folders: one called buku (an outer "project-wide" layer for Django) and bukuapp (an inner layer where the application is mostly built, so you can connect multiple apps to one project).
